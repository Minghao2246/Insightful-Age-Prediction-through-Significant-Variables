# Predicting Age Using Significant Explanatory Variables
# - STAT 301 Project

Various factors may contribute to estimating a personâ€™s age. Factors which may be associated with age include employment status, 
education level, and/or marital status. According to Statistics Canada, 15 to 24 were the most likely to work part-time, followed 
by workers aged 55 and older. People in the core working ages of 25 to 54 were the least likely to be part-time. Additionally, 
women were twice as likely as men to work part-time. 
These part-time rates have been relatively stable over the last 20 years (Patterson, 2018). 
A 2013 study published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that marriage patterns differed markedly by 
age at marriage and by educational attainment (Aughinbaugh et al., 2013).

The data we will be using was collected by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker, and extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database.
This data contains several variables: age (17 and up), education level (preschool and above), marital status, relationship status, 
race, gender, occupation, weekly working hours, etc. 
We will be focusing on the prediction of average age, as well as the relationship between age and input variables in our project.
